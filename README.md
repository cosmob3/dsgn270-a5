# DSGN-270 // Assignment 5 - Figma Prototype // Bryan Velasco

## Design System

- For the font, this was I font I came across and I really liked the way it looked. Plus, I feel like it is fairly readable.
- The colour scheme I got from [Awwwards.](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/around-the-world-in-12-dishes).

## Prototyping for site

- Prototyping the website wasn't too difficult. I found it that figma made it pretty easy to just drag and drop the navigation arrows with ease.
- The one problem I ran into was that I accidentally started a second flow and I didn't realize till half way through and somehow ended up deleting both and starting from scratch to make sure I didn't miss anything.

## Prototype a feature

- I feel like the mockup I made is pretty simple so I just added hover states to all of the buttons except for the ones in the Portfolie Page.
- Took a bit to properly set up the prototype on the button but going over the zoom recording of Jessica's demo really helped
